The “Sources” panel
Your Chrome version may look a little bit different, but it still should be obvious what’s there.
Open the example page in Chrome.
Turn on developer tools with F12 (Mac: Cmd+Opt+I).
Select the Sources panel.


Breakpoints
Let’s examine what’s going on within the code of the example page. In hello.js, click at line number 4. Yes, right on the 4 digit, not on the code.
Congratulations! You’ve set a breakpoint. Please also click on the number for line 8.
It should look like this (blue is where you should click):


The command “debugger”
We can also pause the code by using the debugger command in it, like this:
function hello(name) {
  let phrase = `Hello, ${name}!`;
  debugger;  // <-- the debugger stops here
  say(phrase);
}

// open console to see
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log("value,", i);
}
